Datawrapper Tutorial 
About Datawrapper 

Datawrapper is a web-based tool to create interactive data visualizations in a variety of formats including commonly used graph types such as bar, column, line, and pie charts as well as scatter plots and choropleth maps. This tool is one of the simplest data visualization tools to use with an intuitive user interface and a robust library of tutorials that provides step by step instructions on how to create different visualization types. In addition, it includes multiple features to enhance the overall accessibility of its data visualizations such as alt text for images and guidance for selecting accessible colors that are high contrast runs color blindness tests on the colors in your visualization. 
How to Use Datawrapper 

Prepare your data. In order to upload your data for visualization, you’ll need to make the data readable for the software. This is often the longest and most complicated step regardless of the visualization tool that you use. There are multiple tools and methods available to clean data but to start we’re going to provide an overview of how to do this using Excel or Google Sheets. If you are interested in learning more about this using a more powerful data cleaning tool called Open Refine, check out this tutorial on Tidy(ish) Data created by the TriCo DS Committee. 

 Datawrapper provides a detailed tutorial walking through the process of preparing your data for upload using a sample data set from the World Bank using urban population data. In general these steps and principles might be helpful as you prepare your data: 
Before you begin cleaning your data for visualization, create a duplicate data sheet and rename it to indicate that it has been manipulated. Naming conventions such as “raw data,” “data” or “data original” and “data edited” can help differentiate your file types. 
Clean your header and delete any extra rows above the header. Excel files of raw data often contain extra rows of information above the actual file. Including these rows of data will prevent us from filtering or sorting the data you actually want to visualize. 
Look for headers that contain double row headers and unmerge the cells. 
In Excel, you can do this by selecting the merged cells, then navigating to the “Home” tab, selecting the “Alignment” group, and clicking the “Merge & Center” button. From here, you’ll select “Unmerge Cells” from the drop down menu. 
In Google Sheets, select the merged cell, then “Format,” “Merge cells,” and “Unmerge.”
Delete metrics in your data cells. Delete metrics such as €, $, kg, %, km/h, etc. in your data cells. YOu can add back these metrics when you create the chart in datawrapper. 
Rename your column names and make sure that they make sense to outside readers. Abbreviations specific to your data might make sense to you but could be confusing to an outside reader when embedded in a visualization. 
Note:  You can also bypass this step and use one of the sample data sets preloaded to datawrapper while learning how to use the tool. 

Create an account
Visit https://www.datawrapper.de.
Click “Sign up” and create a free account using your email or Google login. 
Upload your data to datawrapper. 
Upload your data. You can do this by copying and pasting your data, uploading an XLS or CSV file, connecting directly with Google Sheets or linking out to an external data source. For the purposes of this tutorial, we’ll use one of the sample data sets preloaded into Datawrapper (Global CO2 emissions). 
Check and describe your data. Make sure that Datawrapper is interpreting your data correctly. It will label and highlight your data accordingly: 
Number columns will be highlighted in blue 
Dates will be highlighted in green 
Text will be highlighted in black 
Red highlights indicate an error in your data set that needs to be fixed
– cells contain now data 
Visualize your data. Select the type of chart you’d like to create. Datawrapper will display previews of each type so you can get a sense about what the final output will look like. 
Refine your data. From this window, you can limit your visualization to custom ranges as well as adjust the size of the graph, its color, and labels. 
Annotate your data. From this window, you can add a custom title, description, notes, alt text, and link out to your data source. 
Adjust your layout. From this window, you can customize the layout of your visualization including the pixel size and run various color blindness and accessibility tests. 



9. Share your visualization. There are a few ways to do this depending on the method you’d like to use to share your visualization.
Static exports:  If you’d like to export a static copy of your visualization, you do not need to publish it. Simply select export as a png file.  
If you’d like to embed your completed visualization on a website or social media platform, you’ll need to publish it first. This option provides links to your published visualization as well as embed codes (iframes) that can be embedded onto a website. For more information on how to embed iframes onto some of the most popular content management systems such as WordPress, see Datawrapper’s detailed tutorial on how to share and embed visualizations. 

General Accessibility Guidelines for Data Visualization 
While there are no established definition for what makes a data visualization accessible, these general guidelines and those in Jonathan Schwabish, Susan Popkin, and Alice Feng’s Do No Harm Guide: Centering Accessibility in Data Visualization and Amy Cesal’s “Writing Alt Text for Data Visualization” provide some framework for description. 
If possible, add a thorough description to the HTML to fully convey the meaning of the visualization. 
Supplement your alt text with a link to the raw data. 
Here’s a simple formula recommended by Amy Cesal for writing alt text for data visualization 
[chart type] of [data type] where [reason for including chart] with a [link to data source] 
How to add alt text in the HTML code  
Add alt text alt=” to any image that adds meaning inside the image tag <img>. When possible, add a long description longdesc=”.

About Datawrapper
Datawrapper is a web-based tool for creating interactive data visualizations in a variety of formats. It supports commonly used chart types such as bar, column, line, and pie charts, as well as scatter plots and choropleth maps. It is one of the most intuitive and accessible tools for beginners, offering a clean user interface and a robust library of tutorials with step-by-step instructions.

Datawrapper also includes several built-in features to enhance accessibility, such as the ability to add alt text for images and tools for selecting high-contrast, colorblind-safe palettes. It can even run color blindness tests on your visualization.

How to Use Datawrapper
1. Prepare Your Data
Before uploading data to Datawrapper, it must be cleaned and structured in a way the software can interpret. This step often takes the most time—regardless of the visualization tool.

We recommend using Excel or Google Sheets for basic data cleaning. For more advanced options, see the TriCo DS Committee’s Tidy(ish) Data tutorial.

Tips for cleaning your data:

Make a duplicate of your data file and rename it to indicate that it has been edited. Naming conventions like “raw_data,” “data_original,” and “data_edited” can help.

Remove extra rows above the header. These often appear in downloaded Excel files and will interfere with chart generation.

Unmerge cells in any double-row headers.

In Excel: Select the cells → “Home” tab → “Merge & Center” → “Unmerge Cells.”

In Google Sheets: Select the cells → “Format” → “Merge cells” → “Unmerge.”

Delete metrics like €, $, %, etc., from your data cells. You can add them back in Datawrapper during chart creation.

Rename your column headers using clear, descriptive titles. Avoid abbreviations that won’t be meaningful to outside readers.

💡 You can skip this step and experiment using one of Datawrapper’s sample datasets (e.g., Global CO₂ emissions) while you learn the tool.

Black = text

Red = errors (e.g., empty cells or unrecognized formats)

Correct any issues before proceeding.

5. Visualize Your Data
Choose a chart type from the preview options (e.g., bar, line, pie).

Click “Proceed” when ready.

6. Refine Your Chart
From the Refine tab, you can:

Limit ranges,

Resize the chart,

Change colors,

Edit labels and axis formatting.

A title,

A description,

Alt text,

A link to your data source.

These additions improve accessibility and clarity.

8. Adjust Layout
Under Layout, you can:

Change chart dimensions,

Run color blindness simulations,

Check overall accessibility compliance.

9. Share Your Visualization
Options:

Static export: Download as a PNG file (no publishing required).

Web embed: Publish the visualization, then copy the shareable link or iframe embed code.

For WordPress and other CMS platforms, see Datawrapper’s embed guide.

General Accessibility Guidelines for Data Visualization
While there are no universal standards, the following best practices—based on resources such as Do No Harm: Centering Accessibility in Data Visualization by Schwabish, Popkin, and Feng, and Amy Cesal’s Writing Alt Text for Data Visualization—can help:

Provide descriptive HTML alt text to convey the chart’s meaning.

Add a link to the raw data alongside the visualization.

Use this alt text formula from Amy Cesal:

[chart type] of [data type] where [reason for including chart], with a [link to data source]

Example HTML syntax:

<img src="chart.png" alt="Bar chart of CO₂ emissions by country showing that China and the US are the largest contributors. Data from the World Bank.">
For longer descriptions, use:

<img src="chart.png" alt="Short alt text" longdesc="full-description.html">
